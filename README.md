# SBA318-ExpressRestfulApii
This is a README file for a web application built with Node.js and Express.js. Below is an overview of the structure and functionality of the application:

Overview:
Express.js: This application is built using Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js.
Dependencies:
express: The Express.js framework.
path: The core Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
Middleware:
Logger Middleware: Logs information about each incoming request, including the request method and URL.
Authentication Middleware: Simulates user authentication by checking for a specific authorization header (Bearer token123). If the user is not authenticated, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
Error Handling Middleware: Catches errors that occur during the request processing pipeline and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.
Routes:
Authenticated Route: A route (/authenticated-route) that requires authentication to access. If authenticated, it returns a JSON response indicating successful access.
Error Route: A route (/error) that deliberately throws an error for demonstration purposes.
Views:
The application uses the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine for rendering views.
The main view (index.ejs) renders a list of sample users passed from the server.
Running the Application:
Install dependencies: Run npm install to install required dependencies.
Start the server: Run node <filename>.js to start the server. Replace <filename> with the name of the file containing the Express application code.
Access the application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the rendered index view.
Environment Variables:
The application listens on the port specified by the PORT environment variable. If PORT is not set, it defaults to port 3000.
Sample Data:
The application includes sample data for demonstration purposes, consisting of an array of user objects with id and name properties.
Notes:
This README provides an overview of the application structure and functionality. Additional details about specific routes, middleware, or views can be found in the respective files within the project directory.
